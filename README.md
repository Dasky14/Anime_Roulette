# MAL Anime Randomiser

A personal project made to replace the removed "random anime" feature on CrunchyRoll. The project is built around the open Jikan API that catalogues MyAnimeList's entries, and has several options for filtering the results.

Allows filtering anime by name, score, type, age rating, status, and others. This search result is then used to pick a random anime, which can then be opened in browser to see the MAL page for it.

Alternatively you can build the executable yourself by downloading the project files, but it's a much larger download due to binaries and unused assets.
