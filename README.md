# MAL Anime Randomiser

A personal project made to replace the removed "watch random anime" feature on CrunchyRoll. The project is built in Unreal Engine 5 around the open Jikan API that catalogues MyAnimeList's entries, and has several options for filtering the results.

Allows filtering anime by name, score, type, age rating, status, and others. This search result is then used to pick a random anime by throwing a die, which can then be opened in browser to see the MAL page for it.
